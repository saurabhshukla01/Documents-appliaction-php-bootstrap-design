One news article we read says the landfill is spread <strong>as wide as</strong> <strong>29 football fields</strong> and is nearly <strong>as high as the Qutab Minar</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Qutab Minar is a breathtaking monument, the <strong>towers of trash </strong>at Ghazipur are making residents in surrounding areas like us gag and hold our breath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stench of rotting waste is <strong>releasing poisonous gases making everyone sick</strong>. We can’t even open our windows without vomiting. The toxic air has ruined our air purifiers and caused pipe leakages. Think of what it is doing to our bodies. It’s been <strong>17 years</strong> <strong>since Ghazipur ran out of space and should have been shut down but the trucks continue to dump waste there</strong>. Two years ago, a part of this <strong>landfill collapsed</strong>, <strong>killing 2 people</strong>.

Save us from this <strong>ticking time bomb.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have started this petition because we are sick of falling sick.

Quantum computers might one day revolutionise tasks that would take existing computers years, including the hunt for new drugs and optimising city and transportation planning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe technique relies on quantum bits, or qubits, which can register data values of zero and one — the language of modern computing — simultaneously. Big tech companies including Google, Microsoft, IBM and Intel are avidly pursuing the technology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"Quantum things can be in multiple places at the same time,\" said Chris Monroe, a University of Maryland physicist who is also the founder of quantum startup IonQ. \"The rules are very simple, they\'re just confounding.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat\'s a quantum computer?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDescribing the inner workings of a quantum computer isn’t easy, even for top scholars. That’s because the machines process information at the scale of elementary particles such as electrons and photons, where different laws of physics apply.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“It’s never going to be intuitive,” said Seth Lloyd, a mechanical engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “At this microscopic level, things are weird. An electron can be here and there at the same time, at two places at once.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConventional computers process information as a stream of bits, each of which can be either a zero or a one in the binary language of computing. But quantum bits, known as qubits, can register zero and one simultaneously.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat can it do?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn theory, the special properties of qubits would allow a quantum computer to perform calculations at far higher speeds than current supercomputers. That makes them good tools for understanding what’s happening in the realms of chemistry, material science or particle physics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat speed could aid in discovering new drugs, optimizing financial portfolios and finding better transportation routes or supply chains. It could also advance another fast-growing field, artificial intelligence, by accelerating a computer’s ability to find patterns in large troves of images and other data.',0,6,0,25000,2,'2019-10-23 12:30:52','2019-10-24 12:58:10'),(28,'5db049a15fceb',6,1,'Isteel ','08','','https://callupon.org/stC','Ravi Hindu ',0,0,0,123456,1,'2019-10-23 12:37:53','2019-10-24 12:25:10'),(29,'5db0d2a206280',6,1,'Love','love to miat','','https://callupon.org/stD','Hallo i am adam from gokak what is love?',0,0,0,2326,1,'2019-10-23 22:22:26','2019-10-24 12:25:13'),(30,'5db135a8a143e',1,20,'hgfudsgufhjb','nlknkbjkbjbjb','','https://callupon.org/stE','jkbjkbvj',0,0,0,6765,1,'2019-10-24 05:24:56','2019-10-24 12:25:16'),(31,'5db1401fe6535',6,21,'Diwali 2019: Puja muhurat, date and significance','Diwali 2019: Puja muhurat, date and significance','diwali.jpeg','https://callupon.org/stF','<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: OpenSans-Regular; font-size: 17px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">Deepawali, Deepavali or Diwali<span> </span></strong>is the festival of lights is one of the most awaited festivals, associated with the Legend of Lord Ram symbolizing the victory of righteousness and the lifting of spiritual darkness.

One state blaming another. “Stop your farmers from burning rubble”. “No, you people need to curb vehicular pollution.” “Go regulate construction dust first”.</p>   \r\n<p>   \r\nFrankly, I don’t care who did what and why. Neither do the majority of citizens in North India who are suffering this blanket killer smog year after year.</p>   \r\n<p>   \r\nThe time for finger-pointing is now long gone.

Most of the time, people talk about morals and values but what is happening today comprises no hide and seeks. Whenever any such incident happens, people act and behave too aggressively and sooner with time everyone forgets and moves on.

It has observed that BPL families have claimed that they are unable to<br />\r\nafford LPG refills. <br />\r\nScheme Launched: for People Welfare or Votes Bagging? <br />\r\nHowever, the Ujjwala Scheme was launched for bagging of votes during elections<br />\r\nwith a promise that each rural woman of below poverty line household would be<br />\r\nfacilitated with the same but unfortunately, because of the high cost of LPG refills<br />\r\nthey saw a major dud. The strategy of acquiring the bulk votes was quite interesting<br />\r\nas it focussed on BPL household visits while sitting on the muddy floor and eating<br />\r\nthe meal cooked on the earthen stove or Chulhas. <br />\r\nHowever, to get the LPG cylinder under this scheme the BPL family woman required<br />\r\nto fill a form provided by the respective gas agency while paying the subsidized price<br />\r\nof ? 1750 otherwise without such scheme it would be costing ? 2950. <br />\r\nA Curse or A Cause<br />\r\nPeople of such families did enjoy the scheme until the time the cylinder doesn’t<br />\r\nrequire the refill. With the passing away of the gas, they again came back to the<br />\r\nChulhas using kerosene oil and other kinds of solid fuels. The emitted smoke from<br />\r\nsuch substances led to hazardous health issues. Moreover, as per the World Health<br />\r\nOrganisation, worldwide, 3.8 million people die because of the smoke exposure from<br />\r\nthe dirty stoves. Also, the stats obtained from WHO quoted that in India, 4,88,200<br />\r\ndeaths occur every year just because of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<br />\r\n(COPD), ischaemic heart disease, due to pneumonia, lung cancer, and stroke.

If,<br />\r\nUjjwala Scheme has been properly implemented focusing on the low cost of the gas<br />\r\nrefill then, it could have successfully helped the sufferers which they have been<br />\r\nfacing because of the constant use of Chulhas. <br />\r\nThe use of Chulhas adversely affects human health that it can cause a loss of vision,<br />\r\nlungs problem, inhaling or other breathing problems and a lot more than one can<br />\r\never imagine. For your safeguard, you need to take any action while not fully relying<br />\r\non government schemes. However, the government must support people with the<br />\r\nproper implementation of such schemes. It must organize the schemes that it may<br />\r\nnot affect the people for a shorter time span, in fact, help them in solving all their<br />\r\ndaily hurdles. <br />\r\nOne Initiative is Essential<br />\r\nThe people of such areas are out of the reach of a flourished money, so they feel<br />\r\nthemselves helpless.

This would surely bring a positive effect on society and<br />\r\nthe economy. <br />\r\nAgain, the concluded reason states that the unaffordability of LPG cylinders is the<br />\r\ncore concern of using Chulhas with the help of cow dung and coal that are easily<br />\r\naccessible.

Moreover, the prices are expected to soar more by the end of February 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Triggering of Unseasonable Rainfall led Crop Damage  </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prices of onion have risen drastically in all over the country. The reason behind the rising cost is unseasonal rain as well as the shortage of onion crop. Also, the worst part is that the rising cost has not even benefited a single farmer instead they have complained that none of the onion crops has been fetched because of its poor quality. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Increasing Consumption led to Decreasing Requirements </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In accordance with some sophisticated sources, in India, the monthly consumption of onions was 15 lakh metric tons which shows a requirement of 50 thousand metric tons.

Onion as a staple of each kitchen in every household has affected not only the general public but a huge mass of farmers as well. Indian farmers have emotionally expressed a painful concern because most of them are distributing the old stock of onion because of the damaging of new onions. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just because the wholesale market has seen a huge spike in the cost, it has simultaneously affected the resulting market as well. Wherein, this sharper jump is restricting the public to make a hole in their pockets. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nationwide surge in the spike of onion price has affected most of the Indian states and cities such as Pune, Maharashtra, Chennai, Mumbai, Odisha, West Bengal, Kolkata, Delhi and a lot more. Therein, it has affected the market chain by affecting both the sellers and consumers in buying an onion. Nevertheless, daily consumers are unfortunately are forced to reduce their purchases and are cooking their delicious food as – onion free. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Battlefield between State & Central Government </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, the worst condition expressed by the farmers is the rotten onion which can neither be used nor purchased and can only get wasted by throwing and dumping it in the dustbins. Most of the citizens have appealed to the Central Government to take impactful immediate actions but, the tussle amid the state and the central government is affecting the common man, alas!!! </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Onion’s Robbery at Dusk’s Early Hours </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the robbery of goods that can benefit you in any ground has been seen and observed in several different cases. But, have you ever heard of Onion’s robbery. Could you ever imagine that onions can also be getting stolen?

In short, this food inflation has made the entire nation cry where people are left with no choice just to maintain a cost-cutting for onion. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Indian Government must enlighten the issue and should immediately take the concern into consideration. This is because the continuous spike in the price is neither good for the country and nor for the Indian traders and farmers who are stagnantly witnessing a great fall in the onion demand.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Onion, with which every food tastes tasteless, is now getting reduced from the daily menus, dishes, and salads. However, to avoid the further disruption of the onion trade in the country, the government has placed orders for 6,090 tonnes of onions from Egypt to prevent India from Onion’s Crisis.

If a person gives the quoted amount then, these fraudsters run away leaving behind a no clue of their identification. </p>\r\n<p>    \r\nNo one knows where a nation will go if this would be continuing the way it is. Also, in the era of technology as well as digitalization, Information Technology (IT) domain is phasing the rough period of streamlining cost majorly concentrating on the employees of mid to senior level.

In fact, it is natural that an organization is motivated only with its motivated employees. In the hustle bustle of the competitive era where everyone is a player to win the organizational race, managers of the firm must focus both on the financial rewards and employees motivation as well. </p><br />\r\n<p>However, sometimes employee’s motivation using rewards becomes intimidating for the managers. This should not happen because when your work culture is armed with the correct and appropriate information and tactics then why would managers feel daunt in enhancing the motivation of his employees using rewards in no time. The managers who always develop and revamp the employee rewards program must concentrate on some of the most mandatory aspects. </p><br />\r\n<strong>This article would tell you in brief… </strong><br />\r\n<p>Employees Involvement in the implementation of a rewards program would work better because this would encourage them interacting amid all the staff no matter senior or junior. Doing so would also ensure that the upper management including all the employees is on board with the organization’s reward system.</p> <br />\r\n<p>On the contrary, it should be noticeable that employee’s involvement in such programs is a worthy effort. The managers must always value the inputs provided by them irrespective of their designation, experience and age and then, select rewards accordingly. Owing to this, the employees who see worthy efforts in rewards will always feel motivated and would often act proactively.</p> <br />\r\n<p>It’s also important on the part of managers to assure that how employees can also comprehend to earn rewards. Involving them in the programs and valuing their inputs must not be restricted. However, managers should clearly explain to them how they can earn rewards. This is because, when your employees would be having a transparent understanding of expectations then, they will be capable enough of achieving the same. <br/><br />\r\nOn the contrary, employees must also establish transparent and reasonable performance standards to achieve rewards. This would lead them to engage the necessary efforts as expected or sometimes beyond expectations. Thus, managers must check in with the employees assuring that the rewards are near to their reach. Additionally, assisting the employees with a relevant dashboard via which they could observe their daily, weekly or monthly performance in real-time as per their assigned task. This is because; this would also allow them to have proper access to their tasks and performances in order to have realistic expectations for the expected rewards. </p><br />\r\n<p> Also, it\'s genuine on the manager’s part which employees should also understand that rewards are always based on the determination of the objective performance data. This is because, when the rewards get served based on the same then, more likely, employees feel no biases in the process and generate a right understanding of what is expected from them. Unbiased or fair judgment always fills employees with great motivation, enthusiasm, passion, and zeal towards the work. </p><br />\r\n<p>Assuring that employees are served with the unbiased reward system abreast with the fair distribution would encourage them to obtain more rewards simultaneously would generate more productivity. Also, it must be taken into consideration that engaging in cutting corners or favoritism will render a detrimental impact on the performance of the employees. Whereas, linking rewards to the performance would influence employees leaving a positive impact. Owing to such practices, the employees would be able to see the complete transparency in the work culture, organizational environment and would also apprehend the connection amid their rewards and performance. Thus, all of them will be automatically get motivated to optimally perform in the near future. </p><br />\r\n<p>In accordance with the met expected milestones, employees must be rewarded ensuring that they have fairly received the recognition for their progress including the consistency in their behavior as per the company’s expectations. In such a case, it’s better to discover the team based incentives because this could be effective enough to make employees passionate and enthusiast towards the work simultaneously would lead in increasing both the performance and productivity. However, if an organization doesn’t work on team-based rewards then, it must include it in its rewards program where devoted resources to team-based rewards must be substantial. Such a practice would surely go to leave a significant impact on employee’s cohesiveness as well as cooperation.<br/> <br />\r\nOn the contrary, there could also be a fatal flaw of not rewarding the top performers thusly, a good performer should never be taken for granted in order to maintain and flourish the top talent not only in the team but also in the organization. So, timely acknowledgment of rewards on excellent performance is a must. </p><br />\r\n<p>However, there is also some certain factor associated with maintenance of top talents which becomes obvious and natural after some point in time. This gets showcased when an employee makes it his behavioral habit. Hence, the managers should not offer the non-monetary rewards and recognition despite financial rewards which must be distributed depending on the variable ratio. </p><br />\r\n<p>It all depends on how well employees perform and at what extent does he dedicate himself. This could believe that long-term reward programs leave a positive effect on the overall performance leading to generate the long-lasting results. Whereas, frequent changes in the rewards also give employees surprise where process sometimes becomes excited as well. This excitement generates chaos amid the employees encouraging them to work hard and achieve more not individually but as a TEAM (together everyone achieves more). </p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n ',0,0,0,5000,2,'2020-01-13 10:12:48','2020-01-14 10:47:41'),(81,'5e1d4e3450cae',2,21,'Is Adultery a Crime or has been seriously Decriminalised by Supreme Court?','Adultery is a Crime or has been seriously Decriminalised by Supreme Court agreed in to social media','relationthinkstockphotos.jpg','https://callupon.org/stbt','<strong>Is Adultery a Crime or has been seriously Decriminalised by Supreme Court? </strong><br />\r\n<p> As per the declaration by <b>Supreme Court of India</b>, Adultery is not considered as a crime instead, has been declared as decriminalised by it.

As per the document released by the conference which is also called Teheran Proclamation, it clearly states that <b>“Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children.”</b></p><br />\r\n<p>On the other hand, it is also important to note that, India being the vast population country, one can’t overlook the implications of population explosion. Therein, over the last couple of years, the population growth is found on the urge to exceed more and more, by and far. Additionally, it is also notable that this urge of the population has reached to the surge due to the contributions of socio-economic culture and conditions, historical facts, policy changes and a lot more. </p><br />\r\n<p>Thus, people of the country are requested to deliver a limited as well as a planned baby which would help in the contribution of the quality population whilst population growth and control. </p><br />\r\n<p> Therefore, for a purpose of upholding a right quality family planning, people should concentrate on the below-mentioned parameters that are required to be implemented, monitored and regulated for the healthy changes in the concerning family planning.</p><br />\r\n<strong>No Gender Biasness</strong><br />\r\n<p> Family Planning including all the concerns associated with it must not be restricted to any sex, caste, creed, race, gender, religions, political views, language, nationality, economic status, native place, marital status, disability status etc. Doing so could result in ‘n’ numbers of mental trauma inside the person expecting to have a newborn. </p><br />\r\n<strong> Awareness</strong><br />\r\n<p> Coming to the precautions and contraceptive pills, proper information, awareness and knowledge must be circulated to everyone without hesitations. Sex education is necessary especially when it comes to serious concerns like Family Planning. Thus, sex education should be available to everyone at the right age and time based on the fractioning needs, differentiating factors and some little barriers associated with the same. Hence, it becomes exceptionally essential to understand the information’s quality depending on the background, education and health infrastructure. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Hassle-Free Implementation of Ideologies for Family Planning </strong><br />\r\n<p>When it comes to the implementation and formulation of the entire guidelines in the context of the <b>family planning</b>, there must not be a lack of access towards the hassle-free implementation. Here, access means the level and depth of rigor pertaining to accessibility and affordability. Herein, both the physical accessibility as well as affordability is the two major components that must be taken into consideration while thinking of expanding your generation or family. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Healthy Acceptance of Contraceptives </strong><br />\r\n<p>While intimacy and <strong>another discussion of family planning</strong>, it is highly suggestible to properly make use of contraceptive products that too in a dignified way while respecting the modern ways of medical policies and ethics as well. </p><br />\r\n<strong>No hide and seek in communication</strong><br />\r\n<p> While having a discussion about other members of the family pertaining to the concerns and issues of family planning, proper communication with respect to everyone’s acceptance and ideologies must be respected. This is so because; a small idea or view of any family member could guide a spouse towards the right ways. Thus, clear communication is necessary without pressurizing and provoking anyone. Moreover, coming to the contraceptive commodities, it must be purchased and rendered by sophisticated sanitary personnel. </p><br />\r\n<strong> Informed & Mutual Decisions </strong><br />\r\n<p> A family doesn’t restrict to the spouse and parents instead while panning a baby, most of the relations start getting connected with each other and with a baby as well before his or her birth in the world. So, while thinking of the <b>family planning</b>, each member of the family must be informed well enough reflecting free misrepresentation of the views and personal relationship. Herein, contraceptive counseling essentially becomes comprehensive equipping members to apprehend their decisions.</p><br />\r\n<strong> Not Disclosing the Maternity Matters </strong><br />\r\n<p>Best and healthy treatment is the most crucial factor to attain during family planning and other further processes of the same. Therefore, maintaining complete confidentiality, privacy and security in the treatment and other decisions must be locked amid the doctors, health workers, co-staff and other members as well. This is so because, there are a lot of people who visit the maternity centers every day, disclosing the patient’s history would affect all in making effective decisions for planning a baby. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Women Involvement with no Forceful Decisions </strong><br />\r\n<p>While planning a family to conceive and deliver a baby, at last, it’s the woman only who has to deliver a baby. Thus, this must be ensured that the woman who becomes the recipient for family planning should be well prepared when it comes to the development spheres influencing her decision and other health measures. Additionally, when it comes to the policies concerning reproductive and sexual health, family planning must be called from an educational and healthy point of views involving gynecologists, doctors, and other co-working staff members.<br/><br />\r\nImperative accountability must be reflected in the massive family members majorly by doctors, sex educators, and lifestyle specialists, health personnel majorly including family doctors, physicians and gynecologists etc. in order to maintain a high standard of accountability. Owing to this, whatever efforts they would be putting would definitely bring the fruitful results in marginalizing people while making them self aware and informed simultaneously empowering them to make informed and positive decisions. <br/><br />\r\nFollowing all such essential parameters would help in implementing a healthy and quality <b>family planning irrespective </b>of any differences.

Additionally, such incidents sound to happen in the deserted streets but unfortunately, it happens in the crowded areas where just because of the threatening practices people become helpless to help each other and other records the videos of the incident. </p><br />\r\n<p>Several times, any such sudden and threatening incidents leave the victim in a brutal state of mind, scared and injured that draws the attention of the general public present at the incident’s spot wherein, any one of them who feels essential to inform police, inform them, rest other just remain same in their happening activities.</p> <br />\r\n<p>Also, these robbers are so cunning and smart that while performing robbery or snatching something, they change their clothes that increase their chances of not being caught. Most often these robbers either carry a pair of extra jacket or shirt with them and always apply some lubricated substances on their body so that, if they get cached by someone they could easily slip and can run away. After acquiring the stolen goods, these robbers sell the desired products and earn their desirable profits. </p><br />\r\n<p>Their smooth escaping practice makes them difficult to trace whereas, surveillance of CCTV sometimes could help to an extent. Owing to this, police have now become familiar with their unethical practices but unfortunately, do nothing until and unless they seem their own profit in helping the victim by any means or by a bribe. </p> <br />\r\n<strong>If such remains continue to happen then, where would our nation go? </strong><br />\r\n<p>Thus, people are requested especially the females to carry the essential precautionary measures with them such as a pepper spray, a pointed pen, knife or anything that could be beneficial in self-defense.</p> <br />\r\n<strong>Eat, Repeat and Sleep – Robbery </strong><br />\r\n<p>Moreover, if an accused get caught and punished, their punishment gets restricted till imprisonment of some time. After getting released, they do the same practices again just to eat, repeat and sleep which happens in the jail as well. So, such people don’t get affected while getting caught. </p><br />\r\n<p>Thus, this won’t work in building a better as well as the developed nation instead; both the purpose and practice of crime highly need to be figured out. If this could be done, the prisoners must be rehabilitated prior to getting bailed or released. Also, they should be gone to some psychiatric therapy sessions so that no individual gets threatened again and feel unsafe on hovering on the isolated streets. <br/> <br />\r\nHence, by identifying the root cause of the problem and solving it accordingly could work better with time, somehow and someday.</p><br />\r\n ',0,0,0,5000,2,'2020-01-27 15:06:14','2020-02-07 18:14:46'),(84,'5e32ba8e9b63d',2,505,'Does the server you use, protects your business or leads it towards Cyber Crime – DDoS ','Does the server you use, protects your business or leads it towards Cyber Crime – Odds  using ','anti-attacks.jpg','https://callupon.org/stbw','<strong>Does the server you use, protects your business or leads it towards Cyber Crime – DDoS Servers</strong><br />\r\n<p>It is natural that risk of cyber-attack is associated with each step taken by the world into the era of the digital age.

This is actually so because the word epidemic itself comprises of a huge meaning in its existence. An epidemic could be anything which begins with a small symptom and later turns into a big disease and hence is termed <b>as Epidemic</b>.</p> <br />\r\n<p>These days, the same is happening in the case of Coronavirus. However, people are getting various information and facts regarding the virus and hence, is listed as the infodemic.<br/> <br />\r\nAs the Coronovirus is rapidly increasing in the major countries of the world wherein, China has been hugely tapped by it. The virus has been s threatening and has proven to be life taking amid the people that everyone fears with its name. The major issue is the recognition of the same i.e. how to analyse and diagnose that whether a person is suffering from some illness is either Coronavirus or something else. So, the symptoms and diagnosis of the virus are mentioned below: <br/><br />\r\n· Fever <br/><br />\r\n· Cough <br/><br />\r\n· Shortness of breath  <br/><br />\r\n· Runny Nose <br/><br />\r\n· Headache  <br/><br />\r\n· Sore Throat <br/><br />\r\nThough such symptoms are found to be very common and can be easily cured but in case of such virus, these symptoms should not be overlooked as it has caused a large number of deaths these days in just the couple of days. Thus, for confirmed, 2019-nCoV infections have reported a severe illness leading death. </p><br />\r\n<p>It is also believed that the symptoms of 2019-nCoV may appear either in 2 days or as long as in 14 days. Also, it is entirely based on the incubation period of the MERS virus. Apart from such noticeable symptoms, it also includes some other symptoms as well such as 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. All such symptoms generally caused some upper-respiratory tract illnesses majorly in the context of common cold, pneumonia or bronchitis. However, such illness is basically found in the people suffering from cardiopulmonary disease and the people with the weaker immune system. </p><br />\r\n<p> In addition to this, one should also enlighten that the other two associated symptoms of Coronavirus i.e. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have also become frequently familiar with the people resulting in life-ending happenings. With the sufferings of such virus, approx. 3-4 people out of 10 have been sentenced to death on almost frequent hourly intervals. </p><br />\r\n<strong>What precautions one should take for avoidance and prevention of Coronavirus? </strong><br />\r\n•    Frequent hand washing with alcohol-based hand wash or liquid soap as it would help in killing the germs and virus. <br/><br />\r\n•    Maintain respiratory hygiene. This would be only performed while covering both face and mouth with tissue paper or handkerchief mainly while coughing and sneezing. Doing so would help in preventing the germs and virus and could contaminate the objects or people you come into contact with. <br/><br />\r\n•    Stop touching your mouth, face, nose and eyes because touching such surfaces could result in virus contamination. Touching such parts may result in virus transferring immensely and exceptionally. <br/><br />\r\n•    Avoid consuming animal’s products (all forms of non-veg) and stop being into contact with the animals like camel, rats, cats, rodents, birds, bats and dogs as well. <br/><br />\r\n<p>Therefore, the diagnosis of such symptoms has been essentially required to save people from the massively growing epidemic all around the clock. Your doctors and other health care providers should examine you by performing some of the laboratory tests on respiratory specimens all the major blood test (called serum) in order to detect the presence of Coronavirus if any. If you found the test with positive results, then, you must immediately contact your doctor informing him about your recent travelling, non-veg intake and animal’s contact. A large number of MERS-CoV infections has been detected from Arabian Peninsula’s country and so, it becomes highly essential to note and report about your travel diaries and history or animal’s contact. Herein, animal contact fundamentally means with contact with camel or camel diaries and products.</p> <br />\r\n<p>Thus, if you are suffering from fever, cough and cold then, you should immediately pay <br />\r\nattention to the same before it becomes serious or life-taking. </p>',0,0,0,10000,2,'2020-02-05 11:30:56','2020-02-07 18:14:16'),(89,'5e40d9fb17ebc',2,505,'Caste a Vote Because it’s a Right to Note: Country to Native Citizens','Caste a Vote Because it’s a Right to Note: Country to Native Citizens one vote one value is human rights','GettyImages.jpg','https://callupon.org/stbB','<strong>Caste a Vote Because it’s a Right to Note: Country to Native Citizens </strong><br />\r\n<b>One Vote, One Value…</b><br />\r\n<p> India being a democratic country gives its citizens complete liberty to choose the right ruler and representative for their country with no forces and influences.

Ranging from the election of Lok Sabha (General Election), State Assembly (Vidhan Sabha Election), By-election, Rajya Sabha (Upper House Election) each citizen of the nation has a complete right to vote. <br />\r\nAs mentioned above <strong>“One Vote, One Value”</strong> has a major meaning in itself that couldn’t be taken for granted. This majorly means that each candidate can vote once during the time of Elections to their preferred party. This is so because each casted vote gets counted to announce the results. It’s our casted vote that we perform to choose the party to be ruled after the results get announced on the specified date.</p> <br />\r\n<p>Sooner, the National Capital Region i.e. New Delhi is going to have Elections to choose the Chief Minister of the Nation.

Alongside this, the result will be announced on 11th February 2020 (Tuesday). </p><br />\r\n<p>In addition to this, as per the Election Commission of India, the vote’s counting would begin from early morning 8 am onwards until 6 pm on Saturday: 11th Feb. Whereas, the entire tenure of the present Delhi Legislative Assembly would come to an end on 22nd February 2020 (Saturday).</p>  <br />\r\n<strong>Political Parties are on Race</strong><br />\r\n<p>Also, all the casting voters must also enlighten that the Assembly Election 2020 would occur in a single phase abreast with the voting in all 70 constituencies which have been scheduled for Feb 8. All the political parties are cheering up and boosting themselves to be healthy as well as a successful part of the election. However, as per the political scenarios, there have been 3 concerned contests amid Congress, Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). People just could only assume or predict based on their interest and votes that which party would going to rule. However, the final result will be declared on Feb 11. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Vote has a deeper meaning and value </strong><br />\r\n<p>So, cast your vote because your one vote can change the entire scenario, in fact, at the last moment and could lead a nation towards the healthy and developed ones. Thus, on the polling date i.e. on Feb 8, voters can exercise their franchise from morning 8 am onwards. However, it is also suggested, and one should make a note of it that, you should not vote to the candidate getting influenced by your near and dear ones. This is so because, most of the times, people vote to those parties by getting influenced from their friends, family members, relatives or other acquaintances. On the other hand, the people who influence others are also requested not to brainwash or influence others in such a way that their vote seems useless or gets wasted. Doing so results in malpractices for both the people; the one who gets influenced and the one who influences others. </p><br />\r\n<p>Observing all such observations, the Election Commission of India has moved towards the EVMs (Electronic Voting Machine). EVMs have replaced the concept of Ballot Papers because people were encouraging others for forceful voting and were encouraging the candidates towards the victory. Thus, such practices are of no use, if each one would influence others for forceful voting. Basically, such kind of practice had also become a monotony as well wherein, family traditions could be listed on top.

The raped girl named “Nirbhaya” died because of her brutal and severe injuries in a Singapore hospital but unfortunately, her culprits are still alive till date. Wherein, it was expected that her culprits were expected to be hanged on January 22, 2020, in Delhi’s Tihar Jail, it got postponed for February 1st in the early morning at 6 am and now is continuously getting delay and dates over dates.</p><br />\r\n<p>This unethical behavior of delaying justice is disturbing the nation and most specifically the accused mother. Nirbhaya’s mom is eagerly waiting for the culprit’s punishment. Every time she stands with a hope of some good news for the culprits to be hung but unfortunately and alas!!! Instead of getting punishment, the tenure of their life is getting extended while delaying justice.</p><br />\r\n<p>Nirbhaya means fearless. Jyoti Singh who was 23 years old physiotherapist was gang-raped in a running bus at Munirka in South Delhi. She was so brutally raped, assaulted and thrown out of the bus with her friend (Avanindra Pandey). Because of this incident, Jyoti is named as Nirbhaya. Her friend was also assaulted. Both of them were thrown out of the moving bus wherein, the girl was thrown nude. Her boyfriend tried his best to save her life but unfortunately because of the severe internal injuries she was half dead and declared died in Singapore hospital. Doctor’s strived and tried their best to save her but just because of the lust of the 6 culprits, the girl exists no more. </p><br />\r\n<p>Out of the 6 people, 4 were the culprits wherein, Ram Singh and a juvenile were named as accused. However, the trial of the 5 adult men initiated in the special fast-track court since March 2013 but as of now, nation can see that since the beginning till date nothing has been changed instead, the culprits need of eating, sleep and repeat is getting extended. </p><br />\r\n<p>Ram Singh was the primary accused who allegedly committed a suicidal attempt in Tihar Jail by hanging himself after the beginning f the trial by the special fast track court. On the other hand, as per the concerns of the juvenile, who was also said to be the most brutal amongst all of the people, was sent to the Juvenile for 3 years.<br />\r\nAgreed if that Juvenile was eligible to be sent to the Juvenile for 3 years that absolutely doesn’t mean that his punishment was sufficient enough. Since the date of the incident, it has been almost 7-8 years, the juvenile would not remain juvenile. Additionally, the accused mainly named Mukesh Sharma, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur, Pawan Gupta have been also grown and definitely could not be of the same age that they were during committing a crime. </p><br />\r\n<p>So, with such delays definitely, the aggression would rise in the nation’s peeps and especially in all the near and dear ones, those who are associated with Jyoti Singh. The nation needs a proper justice and answer to this heinous crime. What went wrong at that time and what is going wrong at present?</p><br />\r\n<p>As per the sources and news, it has been stated that the Supreme Court of India will hear the case on Tuesday wherein, the government of both the Central as well as the State Delhi has requested for a separate hanging for the 4 convicts. Most interestingly, the government had also challenged the verdict of Delhi High Court dismissing its plea against the execution of 4 men stay. This is because, the government had wanted a proper notice to be sent to 4 convicts wherein, a judicial bench headed by Justice R Bhanumathi hadn’t heeded this request and said that, the matter would delay further.</p><br />\r\n<p>Owing to this, the patience of the nations is being tested. Additionally, Vinay Sharma did file a mercy petition in front of President Ram Nath Kovind wherein, his appeal had turned down to another convict Akshay Singh filing a mercy plea. Filing mercy petitions have shown that the convicts are trying their level best to be released without being punished and are making each possible effort and loopholes to delay the execution.</p><br />\r\n<p>With seeing all such potential efforts of convicts, the Delhi High Court has given them a week time to finish exploring the legal help and thereafter the trial court will again start the proceedings for the execution of the case to come to an end. </p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n ',0,0,0,8000,1,'2020-02-10 11:35:28','2020-02-10 11:35:28'),(91,'5e42a00ca31e8',8,21,'Now the protests would rule the nation to make any decision or it has become a trend to get-the-point?','Now the protests would rule the nation to make any decision or it has become a trend to get-the-point on social media','xEcuador-Protest.jpg','https://callupon.org/stbD','<strong>Now the protests would rule the nation to make any decision or it has become a trend to get-the-point? </strong><br />\r\n<p>India is suffering from a constant protest of Shaheen Bagh is adversely affecting everyone i.e. both the participants of the protest and the general public as well which is not involved in it. This 24*7 ongoing protest has also termed as sit-in peaceful protest which formerly led by women with the passage of CAA since 11 December 2019. The initial purpose of the protest was to assure the cops intervention against Jamia’s students who were strongly opposing the amendment of citizenship act.</p> <br />\r\n<strong>What’s the use of doing the protest and creating violence? </strong><br />\r\n<p>It’s resulting in nothing except the threat to women’s safety, commodities rising cost, unemployment, poverty and a lot of more societal threats. With a major count of Muslim women, the constant protestors have also blocked various roads in Delhi NCR since December 15, 2019, using non-violent resistance for more than 55 days. Unfortunately, no one could say that how long these days are going to stretch. As of now, this protest has proven to be one of the longest on-going protests towards CAA, NRC & NPRA in India.</p> <br />\r\n<strong>Reforming Phrase… </strong><br />\r\n<p>More or less, the protest is taking a new shape by and by as well as day by day. Since with its beginning with the citizenship amendment act, it has now started protesting against the BJP’s Government. Owing to this, the protestors are opposing the government\'s <strong>\"anti-labour policies\"</strong> and <strong>“2020 JNU Attack”</strong> as well.</p> <br />\r\n<strong>Petition over Petition… Highway’s Blockade </strong><br />\r\n<p>The issues of highway blocking also called (blockade) had also become a campaign for 2020 Delhi’s Legislative Assembly Election with a promise made by campaigners that if the party gets voted into power the blockade would be removed for the election’s day. Moreover, the blockade affected huge traffic in a day abreast with delays of hours in the shortest journeys. </p><br />\r\n<p>Owing to this, around 5 petitions have been filed, as of now raising the issue of highways and roads blockade wherein, the Delhi High Court refused the hearings of initial 2 pleas and quoted towards the police matter. Simultaneously, on the other hand, the Delhi Police stated that they would use persuasion over force to take blockade at an end. When, this also failed to bring the result, again a third petition was filed on 18th January 2020 raising the student’s difficulty specifically during the exam’s time. Therein, the High Court again appeal the police to investigate the matter. Unfortunately, the situation went out of control and the matter reached to the Supreme Court with filed pleas wherein, it has been expected that after the occasion of national importance (elections), the pleas would be enlightened. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Why disturbance in Nation? </strong><br />\r\n<p>Well, alongside all such concerns, issues, violence and riots, one must also thoroughly know the root cause of all such disrupting happenings inside the nation. The CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) was passed by the Indian Parliament on 12th December 2019 that amends the Citizenship Act of 1995. Under the religious persecution’s assumptions, it granted a swifter way to Indian citizenship mainly to those people who belong to minorities like Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jains, Parsi, Christians and people mainly from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. This act also meant for those people who entered India before 31st December 2014. Whereas, neither the act mentioned Muslims, nor did they offer the associated benefits to Muslim immigrants. Additionally, the worst part of the protest is that it has been immensely affecting the country’s economic crisis witnessing an increasing household debt as well as decreasing growth rate in income and other earning sources. </p><br />\r\n<strong>What’s Indifferent? </strong><br />\r\n<p>The protest of Shaheen Bagh began with a minimum of 10-15 women since 14th December 2019. Afterwards, this 2-digit number got extended to the strength of thousands and lakhs. Many people joined the protests including the students and children which then became 24*7 protest. Also, amid the huge crowd, most of the women were Muslim as they found of wearing a burqa. The unacceptable truth is that females with the new born babies or the lactating ones are also a part of this unworthy constant protest. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Hunger Strike</strong><br />\r\n<p>Also, to lead this protest further in most exceptional ways, many of the people amid the crowd have started volunteering it in different ways like Hunger Strike and Children Protest. Owing to this, few of the protestors were on hunger strike for days and later on got hospitalised. What was the use of doing this? Instead, one’s own health got affected and nothing happened, nothing got changed. The reason for the hunger strike was the police brutality on the students, violence on females in Jamia washroom’s and library and all the associated issues with the case. With the hunger strike, people also demanded the rollback of NRC and CAA. Unfortunately, no government office or associated governmental bodies took this hunger strike into consideration and even didn’t visit the protestors of the same. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Misinformation Misleading Children…Child Protest</strong><br />\r\n<p>Also, since day 1 of the strike, many of the children started joining their parents to participate in the strike. In the morning they attend their school afterwards they become the strike’s participant. Now, it seems like Shaheen Bagh has become an artistic space for most of the children because they express their thoughts through poetry, storytelling, mimicry, puppetry and painting graffiti. In fact, many children participate in the sit-in protest holding candles in their hands. Participating children in the protest get dressed in tricolour and express the informed thoughts by their parents.</p> <br />\r\n<p>Observing all such unethical practices, since 21st January 2020, the NCPCR (National Commission for Protection of Child Rights) has asked the concern authorities to guide the children providing the counselling towards the protests while making them understand what’s right and what’s wrong. This is so because such drastic concerns could also drive the children towards the mental trauma likewise the way they are undergoing with the provided misinformation. </p><br />\r\n<strong>The nation needs the right way to run where unity needs priorities over protests. </strong><br />\r\n <br />\r\n ',0,0,0,7000,1,'2020-02-11 18:07:32','2020-02-11 18:07:32'),(92,'5e452081bf68d',3,502,'The Crucial Cursing Concern: Nipah Virus, A Hilarious Epidemic  <br/> Scientific Facts and Origin','The Crucial Cursing Concern: Nipah Virus, A Hilarious Epidemic  <br/> Scientific Facts and Origin safe the baby this virus','nipah-virus.jpg','https://callupon.org/stbE','<strong>The Crucial Cursing Concern: Nipah Virus, A Hilarious Epidemic  <br/><br />\r\nScientific Facts and Origin: </strong><br />\r\n<p>Nipah Virus is a sort of the viral zoonotic disease which is originated from NiV of the Henipavirus genus of Paramyxoviridae family.

Seriously, in the present scenario, social networking sites have replaced the physical presence of the people into a completely new virtual world. Therein, it could be also determined that many various sorts of technologies can equally inhibit or enhance various forms of the interactivity and it’s all credit goes to IT (Information Technology). This is so because, in today’s virtual world, IT is the only major component that applies to social media simultaneously affecting as well as effecting the life of people. </p><br />\r\n<p>As we are talking about the interaction that has been transformed into the virtual domain, there exist different kinds of interactivity that people often take into consideration. Enlightening such concerns, find below some interactivity types: </p><br />\r\n<strong> Inherent interactivity </strong><br />\r\n<p>As its name itself suggest Inherent Interactivity, it fundamentally focusses on machine-based learning. Today, there have been most of the media platforms available on the Internet that are inherently active wherein, it pushes the people to react in a way like a behaviourist computer-based learning encourages people to react. It is not surprising that technologies that control a learner’s responses are often associated with more behaviourist approaches to learning.</p><br />\r\n<strong>Designed Interactivity </strong><br />\r\n<p>Several times it happens that some media gets utterly designed that automatically generates interest in the learners inclusive of engaging interactions. The concept could be understood with an instance. Suppose a webpage isn’t inherently active that it was expected to be but, on the other hand, it could be designed interactively to make the learners the informed and rational decisions or choices.</p> <br />\r\n<strong> User-Generated Interaction </strong><br />\r\n<p>This form of interactivity is oriented with the Digital Age. Some media doesn’t always comprise of the in-built interaction wherein, its end users could still interact either with some physical responses or cognitively. For instance, the concept could be better understood considering an incident of an art gallery. Several times, people inside the art gallery respond either emotionally or cognitively to some of the particular paintings while simultaneously others may just have a glance of it or simply passes by. As per the student’s concerns, they may choose to make sketches or drawings from the painting, etc.<br/> <br />\r\nNevertheless, media that is responsible both in encouraging and provoking people have also cost some associated advantages with it. Therein, it has somewhere improved and deteriorate the interaction’s quality that becomes difficult to analyse or monitor.</p> <br />\r\n<p> Henceforth, it could be analysed that somewhere digitization plays a prominent role and somewhere is a slippery component majorly when it comes in categorizing the media sources on the grounds of learning & interaction. This is so because both the instructors, as well as the learners, often have the options and preferences of choosing and using the medium pertaining that how it affects the learner’s interaction and feedback happening inside the single medium. Therefore, the design’s quality of having interactive experiences is highly important over the medium of interaction that enables activity.<br/> <br />\r\nHowever, it should also be noted that the technology’s choice can often reduce the activity’s level including the interaction’s quality. Alongside this, when it comes to the real scenarios, people are more likely to make use of an amalgamation of media assuring a quality-oriented and interactivity associated activities. Simultaneously, on the other hand, making use of varied media sources or channel are often likely to increase both the workload and the cost as well amid the learners and instructors. </p><br />\r\n ',0,0,0,10000,1,'2020-02-14 15:00:52','2020-02-14 15:00:52'),(94,'5e4bd7366652c',3,502,'Do Parents give their children a Healthy Upbringing to leave them in Future?','Do Parents give their children a Healthy Upbringing to leave them in Future on social media','kids-care.jpg','https://callupon.org/stbG','<strong>Do Parents give their children a Healthy Upbringing to leave them in Future?</strong> <br />\r\n<p>Parents who invest their Morals & Values in their children always expect the best out of the results.

Majorly, it’s a form of bullying an individual that could be affected with a deeper emotional trauma wherein, teenage and young generation becomes a huge trap. Moreover, the worst part is that strangers or people passing by do comment on body shaming seems very common but uncommon fact is that, these days, body shaming is done by our near and dear ones such as friends, society’s acquaintances, relatives, friends, etc.</p><br />\r\n<strong>Comments & Taunts: WHY & HOW</strong><br />\r\n<p>Comments like, why does she wear that, why does he so fat, why are they short and fat or tall and skinny in fact, there is ‘n’ number of comments associated with the concept of body shaming.

Also, society must also understand that commenting someone doesn’t make them feel appreciated instead generates a feeling of manifestation among the people that yes; seriously they have become a taboo for the society where they live. Natural appearance is not in one’s own hands if he or she is skinny or shorter, fatty or taller. Thus, it is mandatory for everyone to self-love.</p><br />\r\n<p> Also, the finest way to avoid such criticism is that, if anyone faces body shaming on social media then, he/she can instantly flag or report that particular content.

Whereas, Feminism to us is equality. At the global times, there is not even a single man over woman and vice versa. The concept of feminism is a very misconstrued and misunderstood topic.
